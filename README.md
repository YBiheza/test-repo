My purpose is to become a front-end developer. It is my major in university but I guess that this pre-stage course is a great opportunity to consolidate knowledge and skills which I got during this semester and recieve some more practical experience. My principles in studing are integrity and high quality of recieved knowledge. 

Now I am program coordinator at the Student center "Hillel". I am working as an event-manager there, cause in my opinion this work can help me to improve my softskills, such as team work, communication skills, manager skills, stress resistance etc.

My current stack is HTML, CSS, JS and TS (learn them in the current moment) + GIT;

As example of code on Javascript which I can write I am adding a solution from [Codewars-website](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard)
``` javascript
function points(games) {
    let res = Number(0);
    games.forEach(function(element) {
      if (element[0]>element[2]) {
        res = Number(res+3);
      } else { 
            if (element[0]<element[2]) {
            res = Number(res);
            } else {
                if (element[0] === element[2]) {
                res = Number(res + 1);
                };
            };
        };
    }
    );
    return res;
};
```
